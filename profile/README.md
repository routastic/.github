# Routastic - offgrid opensource comunication written in Go

Routastic is an experimental P2P offgrid mesh comunication platform that aims to be compatible with [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) protocol while providing improvements in congested networks through inteligent packet routing and extensible phy layer.

Routastic routers monitor and learn about the mesh in-order to make decisions when routing frames as well as use a multiband architecture allowing them to use faster backhalls (P2P WiFi, 2.4Ghz [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa), ...) aiming to make it applicable in more usecases by improving throughput and reducing congestion.

# Software

*WIP*

# Hardware

## Kvar √ó Ma≈ùoj

![Kvar √ó Ma≈ùoj 3D CAD view](Kvar√óMa≈ùoj.png)

This is an experimental PoE powered node that is able to bridge four physical meshes together:
- Long Range `WayFartherThanYouCouldEverKnowWhatToDoWith` ~ 10Km [LoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_sight)
    - [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa)
        - 2.4Ghz
        - 868Mhz
        - 433Mhz
- Short range <1km:
    - WiFi ([IBSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_basic_service_set))
    - BLE\*

\* BLE needs tests and it's coexistance with WiFi even more so.

Construction is currently *WIP*, CAD files, part selection and build instructions to be released one day.

## DiY

`$ADD_YOUR_OWN`

Runs on Linux, should be compatible with pretty much any SBC & SOM with [`spidev`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/spi/spidev) and [`/dev/gpio`](https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/gpio/using-gpio.html) support.

You can then hookup a LoRa modem such as SX1262, SX1268 or SX1280.

# Timeline

This project is currently in extremely early stage and many pieces are still lacking.

Here is the current timeline, keep in mind I am working on this for fun as a side project and this is not any promises:
- ‚úÖ Nov 2024, design hardware prototype
- üìå Dec 2024, hardware prototype assembly
- üéØ Feb 2025, working prototype (software + hardware) for [@FOSDEM 2025 Meshtastic's booth](https://fosdem.org/2025/news/2024-11-16-stands-announced/)
- üéØ Mar 2025, v1 release, will not mean stable, will mean good enough to run and deploy your Mesh routers on but I hope meshtastic users accept and understand some jank and experimental status.
